# Problem : Count Frequency of Each Word

## Problem Statement

Write a program that reads a text file and prints how many times each **word** appears in it.

The program should:

- **Ignore case** (treat “Hello” and “hello” as the same word).
- **Ignore punctuation** (so “word,” and “word” are treated the same).

## Input

- A text file (e.g., `input.txt`) containing any text.

## Output

- A list of words with their frequency counts.

## Example

**Input File (`input.txt`):**

```
Hello world!
This is a test. Hello again, world.
```

**Expected Output:**

```
hello: 2
world: 2
this: 1
is: 1
a: 1
test: 1
again: 1
```
