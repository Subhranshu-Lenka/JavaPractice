# Problem : Copy Contents from One File to Another

## Problem Statement

Write a program that reads the contents of `input.txt` and writes the **same contents** to a new file named `output.txt`.

If either file does not exist, your program should **create it automatically**.  
Ensure that the copied file has the exact same text as the original, including spaces, newlines, and special characters.

## Input

- A text file named `input.txt` containing any text.

## Output

- A new text file named `output.txt` containing the same contents as `input.txt`.

## Example

**Input File (`input.txt`):**

```text
Hello World
This is a sample file.
File copy test.
```

**Output File (`output.txt`):**

```text
Hello World
This is a sample file.
File copy test.
```
