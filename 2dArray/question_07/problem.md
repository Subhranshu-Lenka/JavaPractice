# Problem : Program to multiply two matrices

## Problem Statement
Given two matrices, the task is to multiply them. Matrices can either be square or rectangular.

- Write a function `matrixMultiplication()` that multiplies two matrix and return a resultant matrix.
- You must also **write a `main` method** that performs the following steps:

   1. **Takes input** for the two matrix from the user.
   2. **Validates the input matrix format**, ensuring it contains only numbers separated by commas (with optional spaces).
   3. Check if the given matrix can get multiplied or not. 
   4. **Calls the `matrixMultiplication()` function** with the validated matrix.
   5. **Displays the result** appropriately.


# Example 1
```
Input: 
m1[m][n] =  [ 
            [1, 1], 
            [2, 2] 
            ]
m2[n][p] = [ 
            [1, 1], 
            [2, 2] 
        ]

Output: res[m][p] = [ 
                [3, 3], 
                [6, 6] 
            ]
```
