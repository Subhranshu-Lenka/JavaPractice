Problem : Anagram
Problem Statement
Given two non-empty strings s1 and s2, consisting only of lowercase English letters, determine whether they are anagrams of each other or not.

Two strings are considered anagrams if they contain the same characters with exactly the same frequencies, regardless of their order.

Write a function checkAnagram(String s1, String s2) that returns:

true if both strings are anagrams.
false otherwise.
You must also write a main function that:
Takes user input for two strings.
Sanitizes the input and ensures the string contains only lowercase English letters.
Calls the checkAnagram() function and prints the result.
Example 1:
Input: s1 = "geeks" s2 = "kseeg"

Output: true

Explanation: Both the string have same characters with same frequency. So, they are anagrams.

Example 2:
Input: s1 = "allergy", s2 = "allergyy"

Output: false

Explanation: Although the characters are mostly the same, s2 contains an extra 'y' character. Since the frequency of characters differs, the strings are not anagrams.

Example 3:
Input: s1 = "listen", s2 = "lists"

Output: false

Explanation: The characters in the two strings are not the same â€” some are missing or extra. So, they are not anagrams.
