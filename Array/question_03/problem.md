# Problem: Merge Sort

## Problem Statement
Implement the **Merge Sort** algorithm to sort an array of integers in ascending order.  

Merge Sort is a **divide and conquer** algorithm that works as follows:  
1. Divide the array into two halves.  
2. Recursively sort each half.  
3. Merge the two sorted halves into a single sorted array.  

Your task is to write a function that takes an array of integers and returns a sorted array.

**Example 1:**
```text
Input: arr[] = [5, 3, 8, 4, 2]
Output: [2, 3, 4, 5, 8]
```
